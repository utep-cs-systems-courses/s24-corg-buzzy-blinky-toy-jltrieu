# when the toy is blinky and buzzy

current state of the toy is that it will make a loud medium-pitched noise and
alternate the red and green LEDs in one second intervals. thats it

todo:
- get some brightening/dimmening action going on
- convert state machine to assembly
- use buttons to transition the state machine / make this thing stop making
the noise
